# PythonKnowledgeBase
# Python Data Structures Project
This project contains several Python scripts that demonstrate the use of basic data structures such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Each script contains examples of how to create, manipulate, and iterate over these data structures.

# Getting Started
To run the scripts in this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Ronin2494/PythonKnowledgeBase.git
# Project Structure
The project has the following structure:

# Running the Scripts
To run a script, navigate to the project directory in a terminal and type python [script name]. For example, to run the lists.py script, type the following command:
python file_name.py

Acknowledgments
The examples in this project were inspired by the official Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html.
Feel free to modify this README file to suit your specific project requirements. The most important thing is to provide clear and concise instructions for running the scripts in your project, and to provide a brief overview of what the project does.
